To get a full 20 points, expand upon the game in the following ways
    [+2] Include more than eight passages 
	- DONE

    [+1] Allow the player to pick up items and change the state of the game if certain items are in the inventory. Acknowledge if a player does or does not have a certain item 
	- If you drink the elixir it will change the options given during the final knot. It gives you the only option to win the game, but is not needed to get to the final knot.


    [+1] Give the player statistics, and allow them to upgrade once or twice. Gate certain options based on statistics (high or low. Maybe a weak person can only do things a strong person can't, and vice versa)
	- You can upgrade twice. Once by using armor (+1 strength) and another by drinking elixir (+3 health). You cannot access the final knot/boss fight if you do not upgrade your armor. These stats are displayed throughout.

    [+1] Keep track of visited passages and only display the description when visiting for the first time (or requested)
	- not done.
